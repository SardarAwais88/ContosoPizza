In this module, you've created an ASP.NET Core web API running on .NET. The web API creates, reads, updates, and deletes pizzas from an in-memory cache.

You've learned that creating a web API with ASP.NET Core starts by creating a new application using the ASP.NET Core Web API template, then creating classes which inherit from the ControllerBase class and contain methods that respond to HTTP requests. Since this pattern allows you to focus on a single controller action at a time, with a little practice you can create functional web APIs pretty quickly.

In this module, we used an in-memory cache. This allowed us to focus on learning web API concepts, but has some obvious limitations for real world applications - if the application is stopped or crashes, all our changes are lost! In a real world application, you'll want to store your data in a backing store like a database. You can learn how to persist and retrieve relational data using Entity Framework core in this tutorial.
